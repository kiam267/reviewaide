# Review Aide Software

This is a dashboard that features two types of user layers:
one for vendors and the other for super-admins. The software
provides a QR code or a link that customers can use to leave
reviews about a project. Customers can submit two types of
reviews: public and private.

Within the dashboard, vendors can analyze how many people
have submitted reviews and determine which type of review is
more commonâ€”public or private. Additionally, vendors have
the capability to create multiple QR codes.

## Available Features

- When the vendor signup for the first time, they will need
  permission from the super admin.
- The vendor can create multiple QR codes.
- They can add links to Facebook, Google, and more.
- If anyone leaves a private review, it will automatically
  be added to the dashboard.
- When a review is submitted and the button is pressed, a
  submit sound will play.
- The vendor can see how many reviews they have received.
- Vendors can also compare two types of reviews.
- When a user submits a review, the vendor will receive an
  email notification.
